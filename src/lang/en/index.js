  newPaperWalletAdvice:"<p>You should create an NKN Paper Wallet, before you start buying or mining NKN. An NKN Paper Wallet is just like an ordinary wallet which is printed on paper. It might sound weird at first, however, it is the safest method to store your NKN. The fact that, your NKN can be stored at your house, at the bank in a locker box or in a cookie box buried behind your house, is an important advantage of the Paper Wallets, if compared to an Online Wallet. The Paper Wallet is not part of the Internet. No hacker can gain access to your precious NKN. Unless, he would find your cookie box behind your house. <br><br> <i>A disadvantage of the Paper Wallet is the fact that, the availability of the NKN is belayed as the NKN has to be transferred back to the Online Wallet before it can be used.</i></p>",
